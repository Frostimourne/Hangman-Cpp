# Overview

This program demonstrates getting "back into the saddle" with programming for me.  As mentioned in my short Hello World ReadMe, I originally started programming in C++ around 10 years ago, and so felt it was fitting to do an actual project, albeit a small one, in C++ to freshen up on some simple behaviors of the language.

With the goal of creating a simple, classic hangman game, I also wanted to demonstrate the usage of 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

All coding was done inside of Visual Studio code, as I just can't seem to get away from Windows yet.  VS Code conveniently contains my terminal, CMake, and Intellisense for quickly being able to test and debug C++ quickly.

While newer languages are easier, I haven't found too much trouble dipping back into a more "mature" language like C++.  Modern IDE's are very good at catching missing semicolons, curly braces, 

# Useful Websites

As always, Google is a wonderful assistant when programming to be able to check syntax and learn about libraries and their functions.  The most common sites I used for troubleshooting and learning are:

- [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/)
- [CPlusPlus.com](http://cplusplus.com/)

# Future Work

While I'm not planning on releasing this incredible program in any commercial capacity to actual users, there are a number of improvements and additions that could be made:

- Optimizations to handling ASCII image generation/manipulation.  Currently very hard-coded and non-scalable
- Tracking stats over multiple sessions, or tracking stats for multiple users over multiple sessions
- Main Menu: Options to select word list file to load into program, difficulty options, user selection, a nice ASCII logo, etc.
